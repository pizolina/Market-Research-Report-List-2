<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Aerosol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metered Dose Inhaler</li><li>Dry Powder Inhaler</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical aerosol market consists of two main types: metered dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). MDIs are pressurized canisters that deliver a measured dose of medication in the form of a fine mist or spray, which can be inhaled by the patient. DPIs, on the other hand, deliver medication in the form of a dry powder that is released when the patient inhales through the device. Both MDIs and DPIs are commonly used for the treatment of respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p></p>
