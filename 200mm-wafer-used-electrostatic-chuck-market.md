<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 200mm Wafer Used Electrostatic Chuck Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coulomb Type</li><li>Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The 200mm wafer used electrostatic chuck market comprises two types: Coulomb type and Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) type. The Coulomb type utilizes electrostatic force generated by two oppositely charged objects, attracting and holding the wafer in place. Meanwhile, the JR type utilizes a special polymer material sandwiched between the wafer and chuck. This material becomes electrically conductive when heated, allowing the wafer to be retained by the chuck. Both types offer efficient wafer handling in semiconductor manufacturing without the need for mechanical clamps or vacuum suction.</p></p>
