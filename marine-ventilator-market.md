<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Flow</li><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine ventilator market consists of various types, namely axial flow, centrifugal, and other markets. Axial flow ventilators are designed to move air parallel to the shaft axis and are suitable for low-pressure applications. On the other hand, centrifugal ventilators use rotating impellers to create pressure to move air perpendicular to the shaft axis. They are more efficient and ideal for medium to high-pressure conditions. The "other" market segment encompasses alternative or specialized ventilator types that may differ in their operational mechanisms and niche applications.</p></p>
