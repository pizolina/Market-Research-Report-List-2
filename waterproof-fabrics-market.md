<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waterproof Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Breathable Waterproof Fabrics</li><li>Non-Breathable Waterproof Fabrics</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Waterproof fabrics refer to textiles that are resistant to the penetration of water. There are two main types of waterproof fabrics in the market. Breathable waterproof fabrics allow water vapor to escape while preventing liquid water from entering. These fabrics are commonly used in outdoor clothing and sportswear. On the other hand, non-breathable waterproof fabrics block both liquid water and water vapor, making them suitable for applications where complete water resistance is required, such as raincoats and tents. Both types of waterproof fabrics offer protection against water, but differ in their ability to allow air circulation.</p></p>
