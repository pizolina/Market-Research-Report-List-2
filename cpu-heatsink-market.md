<p><p>A CPU heatsink, also known as a CPU cooler, is a device used to cool down the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Its main function is to transfer the heat generated by the CPU to the surrounding air and prevent the CPU from overheating. The heatsink is typically made of metal and consists of a series of fins or plates that increase the surface area for heat dissipation, along with a base that is in direct contact with the CPU to facilitate the heat transfer.</p><p>The CPU heatsink market has experienced steady growth in recent years due to the increasing demand for high-performance computing systems and the growth of the gaming industry. As CPUs become more powerful and generate more heat, the need for efficient cooling solutions has become crucial.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the CPU heatsink market is the adoption of liquid cooling solutions. Liquid CPU coolers use a combination of a pump, radiator, and liquid coolant to dissipate heat more effectively than traditional air coolers. These liquid cooling solutions offer better cooling performance and are preferred by overclockers and enthusiasts.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the integration of RGB lighting into CPU heatsinks. Many manufacturers now offer heatsinks with customizable RGB lighting options, allowing users to personalize their systems and create unique lighting effects.</p><p>The CPU heatsink market is expected to continue its growth trajectory in the coming years. The increasing popularity of gaming, the rise of artificial intelligence, and the growing demand for high-performance computing systems are expected to drive the demand for more efficient CPU cooling solutions. The market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.90% during the forecast period.</p></p>
