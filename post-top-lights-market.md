<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post Top Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED Lights</li><li>Halogen Lights</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The post top lights market encompasses two major types: LED lights and Halogen lights. LED lights are highly energy-efficient and durable, providing a longer lifespan than traditional lighting solutions. They emit light through a process called electroluminescence, which requires less electricity to operate and produces minimal heat. On the other hand, Halogen lights use a thick filament enclosed in a small quartz envelope filled with halogen gas, making them less efficient and cost-effective compared to LED lights. Halogens emit a bright white light but have a shorter lifespan.</p></p>
