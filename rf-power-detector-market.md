<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Power Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-RMS Power Detectors</li><li>RMS Power Detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RF Power Detector market consists of two types of detectors, namely Non-RMS Power Detectors and RMS Power Detectors. Non-RMS Power Detectors measure the instantaneous power of an RF signal without considering its variation over time. These detectors are typically used in applications where accurate power measurement is not critical. On the other hand, RMS Power Detectors provide a more accurate measurement by taking into account the root mean square value of the RF signal, making them suitable for applications requiring precise power measurement.</p></p>
