<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Welded Eye Bolts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shouldered Eye Bolts</li><li>Non-Shouldered Eye Bolts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Welded eye bolts are commonly used in various industries for lifting and rigging applications. They come in two types: shouldered eye bolts and non-shouldered eye bolts. Shouldered eye bolts have a shoulder under the eye, providing a larger bearing surface to distribute the load and reducing stress concentrations. They are ideal for applications with heavy loads. Non-shouldered eye bolts, on the other hand, are used when a shoulder is not necessary. They are suitable for lighter loads and offer a more streamlined design. Both types are welded onto surfaces for added strength and stability.</p></p>
