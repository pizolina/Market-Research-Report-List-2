<p><strong>The PEGylated Lipids Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liposome Encapsulated (LNP) Drugs</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PEGylated lipids market application includes the use of liposome encapsulated (LNP) drugs. Liposomes are tiny lipid vesicles that can carry drugs, protecting them and enhancing their delivery to targeted cells. PEGylation, the attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to liposomes, further improves their stability and prolongs their circulation time in the body. This application finds wide usage in drug delivery, particularly for delivering therapeutic agents such as anti-cancer drugs, vaccines, and gene therapies. Apart from LNP drugs, PEGylated lipids also have various other applications in industries like cosmetics, food, and agriculture.</p></p>
