<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basic Oxygen Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BF-FOF</li><li>EAF</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) are two common types of steelmaking processes. BOF, also known as the BF-FOF (Basic Oxygen Furnace-Furnace on Furnace), utilizes hot liquid iron from a blast furnace and blows oxygen through it to remove impurities. EAF, on the other hand, relies solely on electric current to melt and refine scrap steel. While BOF-FOF is capital-intensive and suitable for large-scale production, EAF is more flexible, energy-efficient, and suitable for smaller production capacities or specialized steel production.</p></p>
