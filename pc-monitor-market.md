<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PC Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LCD</li><li>OLED</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The PC monitor market consists of two main types: LCD and OLED. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors use a technology where liquid crystals block or allow the passage of light to display images. They are widespread due to their affordability, versatility, and energy efficiency. On the other hand, OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) monitors use self-emitting organic compounds, eliminating the need for a backlight. This results in superior contrast, color accuracy, and thinner designs, but they are generally more expensive than LCD monitors. Both types have their advantages and are chosen based on individual needs and preferences.</p></p>
