<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Conveyors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure</li><li>Negative Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Air conveyors are transportation systems used in various industries to move items or materials from one place to another. Positive pressure air conveyors utilize compressed air to create a higher pressure zone, which propels the items along the conveyor. This type is suitable for carrying lightweight or delicate items. On the other hand, negative pressure air conveyors use vacuum suction to move items. They create a low-pressure zone, allowing for efficient transport of heavier or bulkier items. Both types of air conveyors offer different benefits and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the industry.</p></p>
