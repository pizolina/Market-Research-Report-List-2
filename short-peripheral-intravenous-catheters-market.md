<p><h1>Global Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters (PIVCs) are thin, flexible tubes inserted into a peripheral vein to administer medications, fluids, or for blood sampling. They are usually inserted in the arm, hand, or scalp, and can be removed once the treatment or procedure is complete. These catheters offer a less invasive alternative to central venous catheters, reducing the risk of complications such as infections and thrombosis.</p><p>The global Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters Market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. Factors contributing to this growth include the rising prevalence of chronic diseases requiring intravenous therapy, an increasing number of surgical procedures, and the growing geriatric population. Moreover, advancements in catheter technology, such as safety features to minimize needlestick injuries, are further driving market growth.</p><p>Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a positive impact on the market. The increased need for intravenous therapy in severe COVID-19 cases and the rising number of hospitalizations have led to a surge in demand for short PIVCs. This trend is expected to continue as the healthcare sector focuses on infection prevention and management.</p><p>One of the key trends in the short PIVC market is the development of antimicrobial-coated catheters. These catheters help reduce the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections by preventing bacterial colonization on the catheter surface. As patient safety and infection prevention become paramount in healthcare settings, the adoption of antimicrobial-coated catheters is expected to increase.</p><p>In conclusion, the Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.00% during the forecast period. Factors driving this growth include the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, advancements in catheter technology, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The market is also witnessing a trend towards the adoption of antimicrobial-coated catheters to prevent infections.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ported Short PIVC</li><li>Non-Ported Short PIVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters (PIVC) market consists of two types: Ported Short PIVC and Non-Ported Short PIVC. Ported Short PIVCs have a port or extension tubing attached to the catheter, allowing for easier administration of fluids or medications without removing the catheter from the patient. Non-Ported Short PIVCs, on the other hand, do not have this port and require a separate injection site for administering fluids or medications. Both types are commonly used in healthcare settings for patients requiring intravenous therapy.</p></p>
