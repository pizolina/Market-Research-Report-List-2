<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Helical Thread Inserts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tanged Thread Inserts</li><li>Tangless Thread Inserts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Helical thread inserts are used to strengthen and repair tapped holes in materials. There are two types of helical thread inserts: tanged thread inserts and tangless thread inserts. </p><p>Tanged thread inserts have a tang at the bottom that is broken off after installation. This tang provides a means for easy removal of the insert when needed. Tanged thread inserts are commonly used in applications where frequent maintenance or replacement may be required.</p><p>Tangless thread inserts, on the other hand, do not have a tang. This makes installation easier and eliminates the need for tang removal. Tangless thread inserts are often used in critical applications where tangs could cause interference or contamination.</p></p>
