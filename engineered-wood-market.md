<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineered Wood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plywood</li><li>Blockboard</li><li>Hardboard</li><li>MDF</li><li>Particle Board</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Engineered wood refers to wood products that are manufactured by binding together layers or strands of wood fibers with adhesives to enhance their strength and durability. Plywood is made of thin layers of wood called plies stacked together, while blockboard is constructed of a core made from solid wood strips sandwiched between two outer layers. Hardboard is created by compressing wood fibers into a dense panel. Medium-density fiberboard (MDF) is produced by breaking down wood fibers and combining them with resin, while particle board is made of compressed wood particles. Other types include oriented strand board (OSB) and fiberboard.</p></p>
