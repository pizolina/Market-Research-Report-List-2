<p><strong>The Styrene Isoprene Butadiene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pastille Shape</li><li>Flakes</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Styrene Isoprene Butadiene (SIB) Market consists of two types: Pastille Shape and Flakes. Pastille Shape SIB is created by forming SIB into small, rounded granules, resembling small pellets. This shape provides ease of handling and ensures uniform distribution during processing. On the other hand, Flakes SIB is produced by transforming SIB into thin, flat pieces. The advantage of this form is its increased surface area, allowing for quicker dispersion and enhanced performance. Both types offer distinct advantages depending on the specific application requirements and processing preferences.</p></p>
