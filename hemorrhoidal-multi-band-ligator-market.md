<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemorrhoidal Multi-Band Ligator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endoscopic Type</li><li>Non-endoscopic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hemorrhoidal Multi-Band Ligator market comprises two main types: endoscopic and non-endoscopic. The endoscopic type involves the use of an endoscope, a medical instrument with a camera, to visualize and treat hemorrhoids internally. This type offers precise and targeted treatment. On the other hand, the non-endoscopic type does not require an endoscope and is designed for external hemorrhoids. It provides a less invasive approach, targeting external hemorrhoids without the need for internal visualization. Both types cater to different types of hemorrhoid cases, allowing healthcare providers to choose the most suitable treatment option.</p></p>
