<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LAN Transformers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PoE</li><li>Non-PoE</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>LAN transformers are essential components in networking equipment that facilitate the transmission of data signals over local area networks (LANs). They can be classified into two types: Power over Ethernet (PoE) and Non-PoE transformers. PoE transformers enable data transmission and power delivery through Ethernet cables, eliminating the need for separate power cords. Non-PoE transformers, on the other hand, solely focus on data signal transfer and do not provide power. Both types play crucial roles in network infrastructure, offering flexibility and efficiency while catering to different power requirements.</p></p>
