<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Drones Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tethered Submarine Drones</li><li>Wireless Submarine Drones</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Submarine drones can be categorized into two main market types: tethered and wireless. Tethered submarine drones are connected to a control station through a physical cable, which provides power and communication. This allows for longer operation times and more stable communication but limits the range of the drone. On the other hand, wireless submarine drones operate without a physical connection, using wireless technologies such as radio waves or Wi-Fi for communication. They offer greater maneuverability and are not limited by cable length but may have shorter operational durations.</p></p>
