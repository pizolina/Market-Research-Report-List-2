<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noninvasive Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure Ventilation</li><li>Negative-pressure Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Noninvasive mechanical ventilation refers to a method of providing breathing support without the need for invasive procedures such as intubation. Positive-pressure ventilation involves the delivery of pressurized air or oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs, helping to expand the patient's lungs and assist with breathing. Negative-pressure ventilation, on the other hand, uses a chamber surrounding the patient's chest or torso, which intermittently decreases pressure to draw air into the lungs. Both types of ventilation are used to treat respiratory conditions and can provide effective support while minimizing patient discomfort and risks associated with invasive procedures.</p></p>
