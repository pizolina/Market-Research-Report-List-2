<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Long Carbon Fiber Reinforced Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Type</li><li>Thermoplastics Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The long carbon fiber reinforced resin market is divided into two types based on the type of matrix resin used: thermosetting type and thermoplastics type. Thermosetting resins are cured through a chemical reaction that hardens them irreversibly into a solid state, providing high stiffness and excellent dimensional stability. Thermoplastics resins, on the other hand, can be melted and processed multiple times without losing their original properties, offering high impact strength and ease of recycling. Both types play a significant role in various industries due to their unique characteristics.</p></p>
