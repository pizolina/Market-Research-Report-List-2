<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Concrete Spraying Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Shotcrete</li><li>Dry Shotcrete</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automated concrete spraying machine market is divided into two types: wet shotcrete and dry shotcrete. Wet shotcrete involves using a mixture of cement, aggregate, and water that is sprayed onto surfaces with a high-pressure hose. This method provides a high degree of flexibility and can be used for a variety of applications. Dry shotcrete, on the other hand, uses a premixed dry material that is combined with water at the nozzle prior to spraying. It is commonly used in applications where water control is necessary or when working in confined areas.</p></p>
