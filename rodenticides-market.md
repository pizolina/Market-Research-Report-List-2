<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants</li><li>Non-Anticoagulants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Rodenticides are substances used to control and eliminate rodent populations. Two major types of rodenticides include anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants. Anticoagulant rodenticides prevent blood clotting, leading to internal bleeding and eventual death in rodents. Non-anticoagulant rodenticides work by targeting the rodent's nervous system, causing seizures and organ failure. Both types of rodenticides are used for pest control, but their mechanisms of action differ. Anticoagulants are more commonly used due to their effectiveness and relatively low risk of resistance development. Non-anticoagulants are an alternative option in cases where anticoagulants are less efficient or ineffective.</p></p>
