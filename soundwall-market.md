<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soundwall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier refers to a type of soundwall that is installed on the ground to reduce noise pollution in outdoor environments, such as highways and construction sites. It is constructed using various materials, such as concrete or metal, and acts as a physical barrier to block sound waves from reaching nearby areas. Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier, on the other hand, is designed to be attached to existing structures, such as building facades or infrastructure, to effectively isolate sound and minimize its transmission. Both types of soundwalls are used to mitigate noise disturbances and create more peaceful living and working environments.</p></p>
