<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inorganic Waterproof Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Dry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inorganic waterproof coating market comprises two main types, namely liquid and dry coatings. Liquid waterproof coatings are applied as a liquid solution or dispersion, which later solidifies into a protective layer upon drying. They are commonly used for surface coatings and are easy to apply. On the other hand, dry coatings are applied in a powder form and then heated or cured to form a strong and durable waterproof layer. Dry coatings are often used in industrial applications and require specialized equipment for application. Both types provide effective waterproofing solutions but differ in their application methods.</p></p>
