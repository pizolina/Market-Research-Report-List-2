<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Dilatation Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Compliant Type</li><li>Non-Compliant Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PTCA dilatation catheters are used in minimally invasive procedures to treat blocked arteries. The semi-compliant type catheters are designed with a flexible balloon that expands when inflated, allowing for controlled dilation of the arteries. These catheters are often used in areas where precise expansion is required. On the other hand, non-compliant type catheters have a strong and rigid balloon material that does not significantly expand, providing uniform force during dilation. These catheters are used in areas where a high-pressure expansion is needed. Both types play crucial roles in cardiovascular interventions, catering to different clinical requirements.</p></p>
