<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Double Glazed Units (DGUs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Double Glazed Units</li><li>Low-E Double Glazed Units</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Double Glazed Units (DGUs) are windows made up of two glass panes with a gap in between. Conventional DGUs are the standard ones used in buildings without any special coatings. They provide basic insulation and noise reduction. On the other hand, Low-E DGUs have a thin, almost invisible coating that reduces heat transfer, making them more energy-efficient. They are designed to reflect heat back into the room, keeping it warmer in winter and cooler in summer. Both types offer benefits in terms of insulation and soundproofing, but Low-E DGUs provide additional energy-saving advantages.</p></p>
